# RISCV CPU Tests

This directory (and its subdirectories) contains software which is designed to test the correct operation of the various instructions which should be supported by the CPU. The tests are copied from the official repository at: https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests/tree/master/isa/rv32ui
